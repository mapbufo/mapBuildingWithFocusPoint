## Develop-Plan
### Milestone 1
- [x] create a map-simulator using txt to create a simple map with obstacles (10 x 10).
- [x] create a lidar-simulator, which scans the created map and return the scan-data.
- [x] create a robot class for controlling the movement of the robot.
- [x] create a map class for the created map by the scan-data. This map should be able to be updated.
- [x] choose an algorithm to calculate the path from the robot to target.
- [x] final-task: the robot should successfully reach the target.
- [ ] summary for milestone 1:

### Milestone 2
- [ ] create a simple scenario in Gazebo.
- [ ] write a subscriber to subscribe the lidar scan ScanData.
- [ ] create a global Map.
- [ ] call path_planning.
- [ ] move the robot

## Some features nice to have
- GTest
- use `semantic-map`
- use CNN to the object-detection and semantic-segmentation
- consider the moving object, use maybe KF
